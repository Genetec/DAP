The Plugin SDK enables technology partners to develop their own role entities, similar to the Archiver and the Access Manager roles in Security Center. With the Plugin SDK, developers can create fully embedded integrations within Security Center, using server and client-side components.

The server-side component provides benefits such as failover support, health history and statistics, and database support.
Additionally, developers can use the client-side component to generate custom reports.

It's important to note that creating a plugin requires the SDK gold package, and a specific part number must be included in the end-user Security Center license.
